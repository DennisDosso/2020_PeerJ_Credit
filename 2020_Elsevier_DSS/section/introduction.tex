\section{Introduction}

Citations are an essential component of scientific research, enabling research products to be found as well as the relationships between research products to be created and understood. 
They form a basis on which to give credit to authors, papers, and venues~\citep{ZouP16, cousijn2019bringing, cronin1984}.
Citations are used, among other things, to decide on tenure, promotion, hiring, and funding of grants for researchers~\citep{meho2007impact, Cronin01, Hartley17, Kosten16}.

Nowadays, science and research are increasingly digital. There are numerous curated databases that are at the core of scientific research efforts~\citep{bunemann2016citation}.
It is therefore generally accepted that data must be cited and citable~\citep{LawrenceEtAl2011,CallaghanDPTCKABBLLMHSWW12}, and that data citations should contribute to the scientific reputation of researchers, scientists, data curators, and creators~\citep{AltmanEtAl2015,Spengler2012}.
It is also accepted that data citations should be counted alongside of traditional citations, and contribute to bibliometrics indicators~\citep{Belter2014,Peters2016}.

A central problem in data citation is how to attribute credit to data creators and curators~\cite{buneman2019summ}. 
How to handle and count the credit generated by data citation, and how it contributes to traditional and new bibliometrics, are long-standing research issues~\citep{garfield1999journal,Borgman2016}.
However, even when correctly applied, data citations and the bibliometric computed using them do not always correctly or completely reward the creators of data used in a database.
Data, in fact, is often cited at the ``database level'' or the ``webpage level''. 
In the first case, the whole database is cited and therefore all credit goes to the key personnel of the database.
In the second case, the database has a website with webpages that can be individually cited. 
The webpages use data extracted from the database, which is aggregated by topic and built to resemble a traditional research paper.
Often the creators and curators of the webpage's data are not credited or only marginally credited for their work~\citep{AlawiniDSTW17}.

Recently, the concepts of \emph{data credit} and \emph{Data Credit Distribution} (DCD)~\citep{creditFang18,transitiveCreditKatz2014,zeng2020assigning} have emerged, built on top of methodologies for data citation. \scream{GMS:We introduce data credit to be used on top of data citation. That's correct. But, data credit (partially) relies on a functioning data citation system. At least, we need that data citations exist. Above here. we describe the necessity of data citation, but it seems to be a completely open problem. We need to say that systems to cite data (with variable granularity) exist and are starting to be used. I'd mention RDA too, to show there is community support.}
Data credit is a value that is computed based on the importance of the data being cited in a paper, and represents the impact of the data on the citing paper. 
The DCD problem consists of distributing this credit to elements in the databases in the citation graph that are responsible for the generation of the data being cited. The goal of DCD is to improve and expand the reach of data citation, rather than being an alternative to it. This means that to employ DCD techniques, we need data citations in some form.

\scream{GMS: the next paragraph can be removed. We need this in the related work, here it is optional/maybe also misleading.}\textcolor{red}{\cite{katz2020SoftwareandData}  defined credit as a ``quantity'' that describes the importance of a research entity, such as papers or data mentioned in a citation, and proposed the idea of a \emph{distribution} of credit from research entities, such as papers or data, to other research entities through citations. 
This can be done by exploiting the structure of the \emph{citation graph}, a directed graph whose nodes are publications and edges are citations.
This graph is the model at the core of systems such as Google Scholar and the Web of Science.
\citet{zeng2020assigning} and \citet{creditFang18} further explored this concept by defining frameworks for the  computation and distribution of credit between papers, authors, and data used by papers in the citation graph. }

In this paper, \textcolor{blue}{we consider data credit as a data value measure} in a (curated) scientific database; credit can be assigned to data of any kind and at any level of granularity. Therefore the concept of ``data'' is left intentionally vague, although in this paper we focus on relational databases.
Credit is a positive \emph{real} value, acting as a proxy for the value of data based on the measure of citations, accesses, clicks, downloads, or other surrogates for data use. We call \scream{GMS: Acronym introduced above, we should just call it DCD.}Data Credit Distribution the process, method, or algorithm used to assign credit to a given datum or dataset.

The DCD problem differs from the traditional citation setting since \scream{Is the next list different from the one we have in Informetrics?}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a traditional setting, when a paper cites another paper, a $+1$ ``credit' is given to the cited paper (and to its authors). It does not matter why or how paper $p_1$ cites paper $p_2$\footnote{Note that there is vast research on this topic and many alternative proposals, but none of them currently work at a large scale.}, the result is always $+1$ from $p_1$ to $p_2$ and thus a $+1$ to the citation count of the authors of $p_2$. With a different credit distribution strategy, the ``value'' given to the cited entity can be \emph{proportional} to the role played in the citing entity. Hence, we can weigh the importance of the cited entities and assign credit according to their role.
    % \textbf{Gianmaria: talk about the zp-index in the related work}
    \item Traditional citations are considered to be  \emph{atomic}. A citation from $p_1$ to $p_2$ can never be broken into pieces and assigned in part to $p_2$ and in part to other papers or data that contributed to $p_2$. This is due to the intrinsic difficulty in grasping the role and ``weight'' of the other papers and data, and in automating the credit assignment process.
	In contrast, we consider data credit to be a \emph{non-atomic} real value, which can be divided and distributed to multiple components of a database. 
	\item Credit can be \emph{transitive}, that is, it can be propagated through one cited entity to other entities cited by it that contributed to its content.
\end{enumerate}

%We study the DCD problem in the context of relational databases (RDBs) for the following reasons:
%\begin{itemize}
% $\item 
%RDBs are pervasive in the scientific world and are the main focus of current data citation methods~\citep{bunemann2016citation,ProllR13}.
%Many scientific curated RDBs are accessible via Webpages dynamically generated via queries to the database.
%\item RDBs, being well-consolidated technologies, are widely used. The ``relational database market alone has revenue upwards of \$50B''~\citep{AbadiEtAl2020}. Known outside the database community, they are often the test-bed for new methods that can be adapted to other databases, e.g., graphs or document databases.
%\item In an RDB, the data portions that can be credited may easily be defined.             In particular, we consider the following: (i) the whole database, (ii) the tables, and (iii) the tuples.

RDBs are also frequently a test-bed for new methods that can be adapted to other databases, e.g., graphs or document databases.
Furthermore, the ``portions" of data in an RDB that can be credited can be defined at different levels of granularity, in particular: (i) the whole database, (ii)  tables, and (iii) tuples.

The DCD process is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:system_overview}:

\begin{description}
	\item[Step 1] Scientists and experts contribute 
	the curated information contained in a scientific database.  These are called the ``Data Curators".  
	\item[Step 2] Other researchers use the data in their research, and when possible, cite them. 
% 	\SBD{The rest of this Step is confusing. Rewrote. What dos it matter how researcheers access the data?  and the sentence was not complete.} 
	\item[Step 3] The citation to the data generates credit, that can be used as a proxy for the impact of the data on the citing paper. This credit is represented as a real value $k \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$. 
	\item[Step 4] Given the database instance $I$ and the query $Q$, it is possible to compute the \emph{data provenance} of $Q(I)$. The provenance of $Q(I)$ is a form of metadata that describes the generation process undertaken by $Q$, and the data used in $I$ to generate the output~\citep{CheneyProvSurvey}. Many different notions of provenance have been proposed in the literature for data in database management systems~\citep{lineageCui, WhyProvBuneman, howProvenanceGreen}, describing different kinds of relationships between data in the input and the output of a query. As reported in \citep{CheneyProvSurvey}, these provenances have been used in several applications beyond giving information on how queries work, for example, annotation propagation and the view update problem. In this paper, we consider three types of provenance: lineage, why-provenance, and how-provenance. %\textbf{Gianmaria: I removed some auto-citations to our or just mine works because they were not so central.}
	\item[Step 5] Provenance is input to the CDC problem, whose aim is to compute the \emph{Credit Distribution Strategy} (CDS, also referred only as Distribution Strategy, DS). The CDS is a function that distributes $k$ to the data in the input database $I$, and is defined on the basis of citation policies decided at the database administration level or at the domain community level.
	%Since we are not in a "one-size-fits-all" setting, CDS can be defined with great variability and flexibility, thus allowing for ample customization. 
	In this paper, since we base CDS on data provenance, we describe three CDS, each one based on a different form of provenance.
	\item[Step 6] Once the CDS is computed, it is used to distribute the given credit $k$ to the parts of the database that are responsible for the generation of $Q(I)$. Transitively, this credit is also divided and given to the corresponding authors of those data.
\end{description}

\vspace{0.15in}

This paper expands our recent work in \citep{dosso2020data}, which addressed the problem of how to reward data and data curators who are typically overlooked in current citation systems.
In that work, we first defined the problem of DCD in relational databases, and proposed a viable Distribution Strategy (DS) based on \emph{lineage}, which is the simplest form of \emph{data provenance}. The lineage of a tuple $t$ in the output $Q(I)$ is defined as the set of all and only the tuples in the database instance $I$ that are ``relevant'' to the production of $t$, that is the tuple that are used by $Q$ in the production of $t$.
The lineage-based strategy equally redistributes the credit $k$ to the tuples in the lineage set, thus each tuple receives credit $k/|L_t|$, where $L_t$ is the lineage set of $t$. 

One may argue that this DS is too simplistic, since lineage only tells the relevant tuple used to produce the output, and does not convey any information about their role or importance in the query.
Therefore, one may desire to give more credit to the tuples that are more relevant or {\em essential} to the production of the output, i.e. those tuples that, if removed, would prevent the output tuple from appearing in the final result, or those tuples used more than once  by the query. 

Therefore, in this paper, we expand the ideas in \citep{dosso2020data} by proposing two new DSs based on other forms of data provenance: why-provenance~\citep{WhyProvBuneman} and how-provenance~\citep{howProvenanceGreen}. 
We compare them with the lineage-based solution, and discuss why one may be preferred to another depending on the application and its goals. 
In particular, we show that why-provenance and how-provenance are more sensitive to the {\em role} of a tuple in a query, i.e. how many times the tuple is used and how it is used. 
The DS based on why-provenance give more reward to tuples that are essential to the production of the result set, whereas the DS based on how-provenance also takes into consideration the different ways that a tuple is used. 

For evaluation, we use a well-known curated database, the IUPHAR/BPS\footnote{International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology/British Pharmacology Society} Guide to Pharmacology~\citep{iuphar2018}, also known as GtoPdb\footnote{\url{https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/}}, which contains expertly curated information about diseases, drugs, cellular drug targets, and their mechanisms of action.
We chose GtoPdb for two main reasons: (i) it is a widely-used and valuable curated relational database, (ii) many papers in the literature use, and cite its data (i.e., families, ligands, and receptors). 
Real queries used in papers can therefore be seen as data citations which, in turn, can be used to assign data credit.

We perform four sets of experiments. In the first one, real queries are extracted from papers published in the British Journal of Pharmacology (BJP), that represent data citations to GtoPdb, and are used to distribute credit in the database using the three different provenance-based DSs. 
%We show how, given the peculiar nature of the queries, the three distributions do not present particular differences in this context and why this is the reason. 
In the second and third experiment we analyse the behaviour of the different DS when  complex citation queries are employed.
\scream{Need to talk about the last experiments comparing citation to credit....}
