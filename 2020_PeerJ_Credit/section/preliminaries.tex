\section{Data Provenances}
\label{section:preliminaries}

\subsection{Lineage}
Lineage was first introduced by Cui et al. in \citep{lineageCui}, and it associates each tuple $o \in Q(I)$ in the output of a query to a set of tuples in the input.
In general, the lineage of one tuple $o$ is a collection of tuples that helped to ``produce'' it~\citep{CheneyProvSurvey}.
To give an idea of what can happen with the lineage of tuples, consider the following SQL query \texttt{Q1}, applied to the database described in Table \ref{table:running_example}, that asks for the names of families curated by researchers based in the United Kingdom (UK):

\begin{verbatim}
	Q1: SELECT DISTINCT f.name
	FROM family AS f JOIN contributor2family AS c2f ON f.id = c2f.family_id
	JOIN contributor AS c ON c2f.contributor_id = c.id
	WHERE c.country = 'UK'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{table}[hbt]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
  \hline
    id & name\\
    \hline
    $o_1$ &  Dopamine Receptors\\
    $o_2$ & YANK Family\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  	lineage   \\
  	$\{f_1, c2f_1, c_1, c2f_2, c_2\}$ \\
  	$\{ f_4, c2f_4, c_1\}$ \\
  \end{tabular}
    \caption{Result of a SQL query applied on the database of Table \ref{table:running_example}, asking the names of the families curated by a researcher based in the UK. The id attribute is added to help identify the two tuples. Every tuple is annotated with its lineage, we use the id of the tuples to identify them.}
  \label{table:result}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:result} reports the query result, composed of two tuples. The attribute id is added by us to easily identify them.

Using the ids of the single tuples to identify them, for tuple $o_1$ the lineage is the set $\{f_1, c2f_1, c_1, c2f_2, c_2\}$, since the tuple $f_1$ was joined with $c2f_1$ and then with $c_1$, but also with $c2f_2$ and $c_2$. No other tuple is used in the database to produce $o_1$.
For tuple $o_2$, instead, the lineage is $\{ f_4, c2f_4, c_1\}$.
Therefore, as we see, the lineage is defined for each tuple of the output, and it can be different for tuples in the same output. 

\subsection{Why-Provenance}
Why-Provenance was first defined in \citep{WhyProvBuneman} in terms of a deterministic semistructured data model and query language. 
While why-provenance can be defined in many ways, in this paper we refer to the definition given by \citep{CheneyProvSurvey}, expressed in terms of relational model and relational algebra query language for SPJRU queries.

In particular, while lineage aims to find all and only the tuples in the input that are relevant to the production of an output tuple, why-provenance aims to find sub-instances of the input that ``witness'' a part of the output. 
Given a tuple $t$ in the output of the query, a \emph{witness} is any sub-instance of the database that produces $t$.
In particular, the whole database and the lineage of $t$ are both witnesses of $t$.
Since the definition of witness allows for the presence of ``irrelevant'' tuples, the set of all the witnesses is finite (if the database instance $I$ is finite), but it is potentially exponentially large~\cite{CheneyProvSurvey}.

\citep{WhyProvBuneman} defined the why-provenance of an output tuple $t$ in the result $Q(I)$ as a \emph{particular subset} of the set of witnesses, that is, a particular selection of witnesses. This subset is called \emph{witness basis}.
The witnesses of the witness basis depend on the syntax of $Q$, thus the size of each witness basis is bounded by the size of $Q$. In particular, the witnesses of the witness basis exclude tuples that are irrelevant to $t$ being produced by $Q$. Thus, the basis tends to be very small when compared to the set of all possible witnesses~\citep{CheneyProvSurvey}.
Also, the witnesses are minimal, in the sense that if one tuple is removed from one of these witnesses, then it is no more able to produce the output. This is not true for the lineage. For example, it is sufficient to consider the lineage of $o_1$ in the example above, where the tuples $c2f_2$ and $c_2$ may be eliminated without affecting the output. 


%FORMAL DEFINITION
%\begin{definition}{Witness~\citep{CheneyProvSurvey}}\\
%\label{def:witness}
%	Let $I$ be a database instance, $Q$ a query over $I$, and $t$ a tuple in $Q(I)$. An instance $I' \subseteq I$ is a \emph{witness} for $t$ with respect to $Q$ if $t \in Q(I')$.
%\end{definition}
%In other words, a witness is a set of tuples in the input that guarantees the presence of $t$ in the output. Any sub-instance of the database that produces $t$ is a witness. In particular, the whole database and the lineage of $t$ are both witnesses of $t$. We can define the set of all the witnesses as $Wit(Q, I, t) = \{ J \subseteq I | t \in Q(J) \}$.
%This set is finite (if $I$ is also finite), but it is potentially exponentially large due to the possibility for witnesses to contain ``irrelevant'' tuples. 
%Recalling that $TupleLoc$ is the set of all the tuple locations, we say that the witness basis belongs to $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(TupleLoc))$, i.e. it is a set of sets of tuples. We note that if $TupleLoc$ is finite, then also $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(TupleLoc))$ is finite.

%The formal definition of why-provenance in the context of relational databases is as follows:
%
%\begin{definition}{Why-provenance~\citep{CheneyProvSurvey}}\\
%	Let $Q$ be an $SPJRU$ query. Let $I$ be a database instance, and $t$ be a tuple in $Q(I)$. Then, the \emph{why-provenance} (\emph{witness basis}) of $t$ according to $Q$ and $I$, denoted as $Why(Q, I, t)$, is a subset of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(TupleLoc))$ defined as follows:
%	\[
%\begin{array}{rl}
%      Why(\{t\}, I, \{u\}) = & \begin{cases}
%		\{ \emptyset \}, & \mbox{if } t = u\\
%		\emptyset, & \mbox{otherwise.}\\
%	\end{cases}\\
%	Why(R, I, t) = & \begin{cases}
%		\{\{(R, t)\}\}, & \mbox{if } t \in R(I),\\
%		\emptyset, & \mbox{otherwise.}\\
%	\end{cases}\\
%	Why(\sigma_{\theta}(Q), I, t) = & \begin{cases}
%		Why(Q, I, t), & \mbox{if } \theta(t),\\
%		\emptyset, & \mbox{otherwise.}
%	\end{cases}\\
%	Why(\pi_U(Q), I, t) = & \bigcup \left \{Why(Q, I, u) | u \in Q(I), t = u[U] \right \} \\
%	Why(\rho_{A \mapsto B}(Q), I, t) = & Why(Q, I, t[B \mapsto A])\\
%	Why(Q_1 \Join Q_2, I, t) = & Why(Q, I, t[U_1]) \Cup Why(Q_2, I, t[U_2]) \\
%	Why(Q_1 \cup Q_2, I, t) = & Why(Q_1, I, t) \cup Why(Q_2, I, t)\\
%\end{array}
%\]
%Where the symbol $\Cup$ takes all the pairwise unions of two collections, working in a similar way to the strict union defined above for lineage. That is: $S \Cup \bot = \bot \Cup S = \bot$, and $S \Cup T = \{s \cup t | s \in S, t \in T\}$ otherwise.
% \end{definition}
% 
% As can be inferred from this definition, the witnesses of the witness basis depend on the syntax of $Q$, thus the size of each witness basis is bounded by the size of $Q$. In particular, the witnesses of the witness basis exclude tuples that are irrelevant to $t$ being produced by $Q$. Thus, the basis tends to be very small when compared to the set of all possible witnesses~\citep{CheneyProvSurvey}.

    \caption{Result of a SQL query applied on the database of Table \ref{table:running_example} with the why-provenances of the corresponding results.}
  \label{table:result_why_prov}
\end{table}
 
In a sense, each witness in the witness basis captures one possible ``way'' in which the output can be generated by the query. 
To better understand this property, consider the example in Table \ref{table:result_why_prov}, where we reported the result of query \texttt{Q1} with the tuples annotated with their why-provenance. 

Output tuple $o_2$ presents a why-provenance that is composed of only one witness, that coincides with its lineage. This is because there is only one way in which this output tuple can be produced, i.e. for tuple $f_4$ to be joined with $c2f_4$ and $c_1$.
On the other hand, $o_1$ presents a witness basis made of two witnesses. 
These two sets fundamentally represent the two possible ways in which the query can generate $o_1$. 
One possibility is that $f_1$ is joined with $c2f_1$ and $c_1$, and is represented by the first witness. The second possibility is that $f_1$ is joined with $c2f_2$ and $c_2$. This means that to generate $o_1$ it is sufficient that only one of the two witnesses is present in the input database. 

\subsection{How-Provenance}
\label{section:how_provenance_tuples}

While why-provenance describes the source tuples that witness the existence of an output tuple in the result of the query, it leaves out some information.
How-provenance was firstly defined in \citep{howProvenanceGreen}, based on the introduction of a \emph{semiring} algebraic structure, and it is a form of provenance that takes the form of a \emph{polynomial}.
% SOME FORMALISM
%A semiring $K$ is a \emph{set} equipped with two operations, typically denoted with the symbols $+$ and $\cdot$, satisfying the following axioms ~\cite[pg. 26]{berstel1985theory}:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item The set $K$ is a \emph{commutative monoid} for the operator $+$ with a neutral element $0$. Therefore, it has these properties:
%		\begin{enumerate}
%			\item $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ (associative property)
%			\item $0 + a = a + 0 = a$ ($0$ is the neutral element) 
%			\item $a + b = b + a$ (commutative property)
%		\end{enumerate}
%	\item The set $K$ is a \emph{monoid} with identity element $1$. Therefore, it has these properties:
%		\begin{enumerate}
%			\item $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ (associative property)
%			\item $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$ ($1$ is the neutral element)
%		\end{enumerate}
%	\item Multiplication is distributive on addition, i.e.:
%		\begin{enumerate}
%			\item $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$
%			\item $(a + b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) + (b \cdot c)$
%		\end{enumerate}
%	\item Multiplication by $0$ annihilates $K$, i.e. $\forall x \in K, 0 \cdot x = x \cdot 0 = 0$
%\end{enumerate}

The idea behind the framework proposed in \citep{howProvenanceGreen} is to use the two operators $+$ and $\cdot$ to represent two basic transformations that source tuples undergo as a result of applying a relational query to a source database~\citep{CheneyProvSurvey}. 
Two tuples may either be joined together, as an effect of a join (represented through the $\cdot$ operator) or merged via union or projection (represented through the $+$ operator).


\begin{table}[]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
  \hline
    id & name\\
    \hline
    $o_1$ &  Dopamine Receptors\\
    $o_2$ & YANK Family\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  	how-provenance   \\
  	$f_1 \cdot c2f_1 \cdot c_1 + f_1 \cdot c2f_2 \cdot c_2$ \\
  	$f_4 \cdot c2f_4 \cdot c_1$ \\
  \end{tabular}
    \caption{Result of the example SQL query \texttt{Q1} with the corresponding how-provenances of the output tuples annotated.}
  \label{table:result_how_prov}
\end{table} 

To give a simple example of how how-provenance works, refer to Table \ref{table:result_how_prov}, where the two output tuples of our running example are annotated with their respective how-provenances. 
Tuple $o_2$ was produced through the join among the input tuples $f_4, c2f_4$, and $c_1$. The three provenance tokens are therefore represented ``multiplied'' together. 
The case of $o_1$ is slightly more complex. This tuple, as already discussed, can be obtained through two different joins. The two monomials composing the polynomial represent these two alternatives. They correspond, in a way, to the witnesses of the why-provenance of $o_1$.
The $+$ operator represents the fact that the two monomials describe alternatives and it is due to the fact that the output tuple is the result of a merge of two distinct tuples after the projection on the attribute \texttt{name}. This merge is, in turn, due to the presence of the \texttt{DISTINCT} operator in the SQL query. 
This simple example gives a first basic idea behind how-provenance and how it allows us to track the operations that produced an output tuple. 

%MORE FORMALISM
%Now we formally introduce the mathematical framework behind how-provenance~\citep{howProvenanceGreen}.
%Let $K$ be a set containing an element $0$. 
%A $K$-$relation$ is a function $R: U$-$Tuples \mapsto K$ which maps every $U$-tuple in an element in $K$ such that its support, defined as $supp(R) = \{t | R(t) \neq 0\}$, is finite. 
%We remember that a $U$-tuple is a tuple with attributes in the set $U$. The $K$-relation is a finite function which models a relation $R$, tagging each tuple in $R$ with an element of $K$ and each tuple that is not in $R$ with $0$.

%\begin{definition}{Operations on the algebraic structure $(K, 0, 1, +, \cdot)$\citep{howProvenanceGreen}}\\
%\label{definition:how_original}
%	Let $(K, 0, 1, +, \cdot)$ be an algebraic structure with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ and two distinguished elements $0$ and $1$. The operations of the positive $K$-relational algebra are defined as follows:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item \textsf{Empty relation}. For any set of attributes $U$, $\exists \emptyset: U-Tuples \mapsto K | \emptyset(t) = 0$.
%		\item \textsf{Selection} Let $R: U$-Tuples $\mapsto K$ and $\sigma$ be a selection predicate that maps each $U$-Tuple to either 0 or 1. Then $\sigma_\theta(R): U$-Tuples $\mapsto K$ is defined by $(\sigma_\theta(R))(t) = R(t) \cdot \sigma(t)$. 
%		\item \textsf{Projection} Let $R: U$-Tuples $\mapsto K$ and $V \subseteq U$. Then $\pi_V(R): V$-Tuples $\mapsto K$ is defined by $(\pi_V(R))(t) = \sum_{t = t'[V] \vee R(t') \neq 0 }R(t')$.
%		\item \textsf{Union} Let $R_1, R_2: U$-Tuples $\mapsto K$. Then $R_1 \cup R_2: U$-Tuples $\mapsto K$ is defined by $(R_1 \cup R_2)(t) = R_1(t) + R_2(t)$.
%		\item \textsf{Natural join} Let $R_1: U_1$-Tuples $\mapsto K$ and $R_2: U_2$-Tuples $\mapsto K$. Then $R_1 \Join R_2: U_1 \cup U_2$-Tuples $\mapsto K$ is defined by $(R_1 \Join R_2)(t) = R_1(t_1) \cdot R_2(t_2)$, where $t_1 = t[U_1]$ and $t_2 = t[U_2]$.
%	\end{enumerate}
%\end{definition}

%It is observed in \citep{howProvenanceGreen, CheneyProvSurvey} that if the $K$-relational semantics satisfies the same equivalence laws as positive relational algebra operators over bags, i.e. union (+) is associative, commutative and has identity $\emptyset$ and join ($\cdot$) is associative, commutative and distributive over union, and projection and selection commute with each other, as well as with union and join, then $(K, 0, 1, +, \cdot)$ must be a commutative semiring. 
% 
%The semiring operations document \emph{how} each output tuple is produced from source tuples. If each source tuple in a database $D$ is tagged with a distinct id, the semiring gives the how-provenance for each output tuple in the form of a polynomial with coefficient from the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers and variables from the set of source tuples id. 
%
%For clarity, taking inspiration from the original definition \ref{definition:how_original}, we re-define this definition in a compositional manner, as done with lineage and why-provenance. For this, let us consider the algebraic structure $(\mathbb{N}(TupleLoc), 0, 1, +, \cdot)$, where $\mathbb{N}(TupleLoc)$ is the set of polynomials whose coefficients are the natural numbers and the variable are from the set $TupleLoc$. 
%The how-provenance of an output tuple is a function $\mathcal{H} = How(Q, I, o)$ that returns a polynomial in $\mathbb{N}(TupleLoc)$ called \emph{provenance polynomial}. 
%
%
%\begin{definition}{How-Provenance}\\
%\label{definition:how_provenance}
%		Let $Q$ be a (complex) SPJRU query. Let $I$ be a database instance, and $t$ be a tuple in $Q(I)$. Then, the \emph{how-provenance} of ~$t$ according to $Q$ and $I$, denoted as $How(Q, I, t)$, is an element of the set $\mathbb{N}(TupleLoc)$ defined as follows:
%\[
%	\begin{array}{rl}
%		How(\{u\}, I, t) = & \begin{cases}
%			1, & \mbox{if } t = u,\\
%			0 & \mbox{otherwise}.
%		\end{cases}\\
%		How(R, I, t) = & \begin{cases}
%			(R, t), & \mbox{if } t \in R,\\
%			0 & \mbox{otherwise}.
%		\end{cases}\\
%		How(\sigma_\theta(Q), I, t) = & \theta(t) \cdot How(Q, I, t) \\
%		How(\rho_{A \mapsto B}(Q), I, t) = & How(Q, I, t[B \mapsto A]) \\
%		How(\pi_V(Q), I, t) = & \sum_{u \in supp(Q), u[V] = t} How(Q, I, t) \\
%		How(Q_1 \Join Q_2, I, t) = & How(Q_1, I, t[U_1]) \cdot How(Q_2, I, t[U_2]) \\
%		How(Q_1 \cup Q_2, I, t) = & How(Q_1, I, t) + How(Q_2, I, t)\\
%	\end{array}
%\]
%\end{definition}
%
%We remember that $\{u\}$ is a query expression describing a constant, singleton relation, not a relation value per se. These constants correspond to $K$-relations that assign $1$ to $u$ and $0$ to all other tuples.
%The summation in the projection case is finite since the support of a $K$-relation is assumed to be finite. 
%In the selection rule, $\theta$ is seen as a function $\theta: U$-Tuples $\mapsto \{0, 1\}$.
